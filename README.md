## Nodes

Fundamental building blocks. They form the basis of linked list, stacks, queues, tree and more.
Link or links within the node are referred to as pointers. If the links point NULL is reach the end or particular node.

> Contain data can be variety of data types

> Contain links to another nodes. Can not have links to other nodes.

## List

The list is comprised of a series of nodes. The head node is the node at the beginning of the list. Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node in the list. The list is terminated when a nodeâ€™s link is null. Linked lists typically contain unidirectional links (next node), but some implementations make use of bidirectional links (next and previous nodes).

> Operations on linked list: adding nodes, removing nodes, finding a node and raveling through the linked list.
